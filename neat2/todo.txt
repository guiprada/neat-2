todo
- check errors on
	neat_stop
	neat_window_destroy
	neat_sprite_render
- neat lua should call registered callbacks itself
- check renderer flip
- export initialization constants to  lua
- read mouse position
- neat functions should return error codes
	neat lua should report them
- an sdl2 based renderer camera would be hard to support rotation
	it would require a render to texture
- struct neat_font with atlas
- sprite create should also be a window method
- window get_id
- new_texture should be a window method
- window should have a render stack
- sprite should have a hidden property
- define color c- side
- :) and we should have an animate function
- sound
- add vsync option and soft renderer(options infraestructure)
- test rotations and anchors
- center on point function
- custom allocator
- add  dt calculation
- add fps counter
- change neat.h to return int instead of void
- query texture width and height functions
- structure gameloop
- add colors
- add sound loading and playing
- add window resizing
- investigate joystick support
- investigate network

done
- fix assign rect and assign point
- investigate movement broken by SDL_Rect using ints
- change window management
- print function, investigate freetype2, or sdl2 kerning
